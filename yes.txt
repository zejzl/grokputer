What's the project you're setting up? (Just curious—might have tips if it's React, Vue, etc.)785mswhat is apify store for at apify.comWhat is the Apify Store?
The Apify Store (at apify.com/store) is a massive marketplace with over 7,000 ready-to-use web scraping and automation tools called Actors. Think of it as an app store for data extraction and task automation—perfect for devs, businesses, or anyone needing to pull info from sites without building everything from scratch.
Main Purpose
It's built to let you scrape data from the web (like business listings, social media posts, job ads) and automate workflows (e.g., scheduling runs, integrating with APIs). You can export results in JSON, CSV, or Excel, monitor progress, and scale up without hassle.
Key Features & What You Can Do

Huge Variety of Actors: Categories include AI agents, creator tools, rising stars, and community picks. Examples:

Social Media: Scrape TikTok videos/hashtags, Instagram posts/profiles, Twitter/X tweets (up to 80/sec at $0.40/1k), Facebook posts/ads, YouTube transcripts (100+ languages).
Search & Jobs: Google Maps (reviews, contacts, prices), Indeed/LinkedIn job listings/profiles.
General Tools: Universal downloaders, content cleaners for AI (e.g., Markdown for LLMs), lead gen (emails, company data as Apollo alternatives at $1.5–$3/1k leads).

Pricing: Often pay-per-result (e.g., $0.25/1k tweets), no rate limits, super reliable with retries and proxies.
Ease of Use: Input a URL or query, hit run—get data instantly via API or dashboard. Schedule, monitor, and integrate with tools like LangChain or spreadsheets.

How It Works

Browse & Pick: Search by category or platform (e.g., /store/categories).
Run It: Feed in your data (e.g., search terms), and the Actor handles scraping.
Get Results: Export, automate, or build on it. Devs can create/upload their own Actors to earn from usage.

Why It's Useful
Saves time/money on custom coding—great for market research, competitive intel, recruitment, or AI data prep. Community-rated (e.g., 4.8/5 for popular ones), and it's scalable for big jobs like bulk geo-targeted scraping.
