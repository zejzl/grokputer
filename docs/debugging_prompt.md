# Debugging Prompt

<insert terminal logs + context + files>

Deeply reflect upon all of this and think about why this isn't working. Theorize 4-6 different possible sources of the problem.

Then, deeply reason about the root cause and distill your theories down to the 1-2 most probable sources of the problem before suggesting next steps.

Just to clarify, you need to provide context here:
"<insert logs + context + files>"

So copy/past logs, use your voice to ramble on about what you think is going wrong and @ specific files to narrow down the search space for the agent to look for the root cause more effectively
