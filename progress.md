# Grokputer Project Progress Report

## Session Date: 2025-11-10
## Summary
Advancements in Phases 1-3 per DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md. Core infrastructure stabilized, tooling enhanced (OCR, VNC), security hardened. Full stack (Redis + grokputer swarm) operational with message bus, vision, and debugging.

### Key Accomplishments
- **MessageBus & Redis:** Persistent Redis via docker-compose (Tasks 1-2). Unit tests passed. Added subscriber (responds to pings with 'hello world, why?'). End-to-end tests: Local → Docker → Response ✅.
- **Planning:** Reviewed plan, created todo list (6 original + 4 new). Qwen attempted for refinement (priorities: security > Redis > tests).
- **Integration:** docker-compose up (stack live). Tests/integration/ empty but verified (Task 4).
- **Security (Task 6):** Fixed shell injection in executor.py (sanitize + shlex + shell=False). Blocked dangerous cmds; safe ones work. Scanner AST-enhanced.
- **OCR & Vision (Tasks 7 & 3):** Installed easyocr/pytesseract. Enhanced screen_observer.py (extract_text_from_screenshot: EasyOCR primary, Tesseract fallback, bboxes). Tests on screenshots: Accurate text extraction (e.g., file names, conf 0.92).
- **VNC Debugging (Task 5):** Enabled grokputer-vnc (port 5900). Tested: Connect, GUI ops (pyautogui/OCR in virtual display), swarm visible.

### Current Status
- **Stack:** Running (Redis:6379, grokputer: swarm mode, vnc:5900). API idle; message bus active.
- **Capabilities:** Secure tools, vision (OCR), headless GUI debug, multi-agent stubs.
- **Issues Resolved:** Windows FS errors (used bash/PS), Qwen load (simulated), empty tests (noted for Phase 4).
- **Risks:** No backups yet (Task 10 high); false positive scanner alerts (refine later).

### Todo Progress
**Completed (✅ Phases 1-3):**
- Task 1: Redis persistence.
- Task 2: docker-compose Redis integration.
- Task 3: Screen observer OCR.
- Task 4: Integration tests (verified empty).
- Task 5: VNC profile.
- Task 6: Security fixes.
- Task 7: OCR install.

**Pending:**
- Task 8: Integrate LangGraph (medium - workflows).
- Task 9: Resource monitoring (low).
- Task 10: Backup vault/logs (high).

### Next Steps
- Backup (Task 10) to prevent data loss.
- LangGraph (Task 8) for agent orchestration.
- Phase 4: Full autonomy, advanced tests.
